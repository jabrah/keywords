is an Associate Professor of Urban Studies & Planning at the University of California, San Diego, and specializes in the history of cities and colonialism in Latin America and the Caribbean. Her research examines the intersections of colonialism, empire, and urban space and focuses on free and enslaved Black peoples in Havana, Cuba. 
Dr. García’s work has appeared in the *Journal of Latin American Studies and Cultural Studies*, and she has received multiple fellowships and awards, including a Distinguished Fellowship at the CUNY Grad Center’s Advanced Research Collaborative and Research & Digital Fellowships at the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. She has also held the Transatlantic Research Fellowship at the University of Warwick in the UK. Dr. García is currently at work on her second book project, which explores the use of digital humanities to interrogate how space, scale, and mapping can be used to counter the logics of the archive and help to expand our contemporary understanding of cities. Her work also explores Cuba and its history across time and space.
