is a PhD candidate in the Department of History at the Johns Hopkins University and a member of the French Language Team. She received her BA in English and French from the University of Oxford and an MA in Medieval Studies from Leeds University. As part of Keywords for Black Louisiana, Pelia applies her linguistic expertise to particularly difficult French documents. Her research interests include interfaith encounters, religious experiences (including those of women and minority groups), and perceptions of sacred space in medieval Europe and the Middle East. Her doctoral research focuses on pilgrimage sites in medieval Syria and Palestine (c. 1050-1300) that were venerated by members of multiple religious communities, and what interactions between visitors to these sites reveal more broadly about interfaith relations in the “Holy Land” during this period.
