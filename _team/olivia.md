She is the Keywords Associate French Editor and works on transcriptions and translations of 18th century French colonial documents. Barnard is working on a dissertation about the last slave voyage from the African continent brought to French colonial Louisiana, which was the first to be funded by enslavers living in New Orleans rather than a monopoly trading company.
