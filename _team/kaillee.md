is a PhD candidate in the joint Latin American Studies and Art History program at Tulane University, where her research focuses on contemporary Caribbean art and cultural production – with special emphasis on the Black Atlantic and Diaspora Studies. She earned a M.A. in Latin American Studies from Tulane University and holds undergraduate degrees in Art History and Interdisciplinary Art (dual emphasis in Visual Art and Theatre) from Seattle University. From 2021-2022, Kaillee was the recipient of a U.S. Dept. of Education Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship in Haitian Creole. From 2022-2023 she was the sole recipient of the William J. Griffith Award for Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor in Latin American Studies, awarded by the Stone Center for Latin American Studies at Tulane University. Kaillee works as an associate editor for Keywords for Black Louisiana; additionally, she works as a curatorial assistant at the Newcomb Art Museum and as an archival assistant and metadata specialist for the Stone Center for Latin American Studies. Kaillee’s PhD dissertation, entitled “When I Am Not Here, Estoy Allá: Visualizing Expansive Space-Time in Caribbean Diasporic Memory," places the work of five prominent Caribbean diasporic artists – María Magdalena Campos-Pons, La Vaughn Belle, Firelei Báez, Alberta Whittle, and Deborah Jack – in direct conversation with each other, tracing a thread of multivalent memory keeping.
