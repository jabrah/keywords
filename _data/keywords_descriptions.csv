fugitivity,Fugitivity,fugitivity,"Fugitivity is a keyword in Black studies that captures the physical, metaphysical, armed, and everyday resistance of enslaved Africans and their allies against any and all aspects of enslavement. Rashauna Johnson, describing the ""slave space"" that was New Orleans, points to the specific geography of the region as lesson in fugitivity: ""Nonetheless, enslaved persons appropriated the places assigned them toward their own ends, a point that broadens the received gendered geographies of slave resistance. Because New Orleans was an important port city, it offered a diffuse set of pathways for escape – and recapture. If the politics of place could oppress, slaves reasoned, movement could also become an avenue to freedom. The connectedness that made the city’s location so desirable to merchants and imperial officials – its land passageways, river outlets, and Atlantic access – gave runaways an array of escape options. The fugitives redefined themselves in local “geographies of resistance,” or fled to other parts of the Atlantic World."" (Johnson, Slavery's Metropolis). 

However, fugitivity is a term encompassing more than marronage (which is the act of absconding from enslavers and being out of reach of slaveholding authorities, even if temporary). Fugitivity describes active and intentional resistance, as well as the acts of imagination and refusal that Africans and people of African descent engaged in against slaveholders gendered racial capitalistic regime. 

Fred Moten writes: “What's at stake is fugitive movement in and out of the frame, bar, or whatever externally imposed social logic—a movement of escape, the stealth of the stolen that can be said, since it inheres in every closed circle, to break every enclosure. This fugitive movement is stolen life, and its relation to law is reducible neither to simple interdiction nor bare transgression. Part of what can be attained in this zone of unattainability, to which the eminently attainable ones have been relegated, which they occupy but cannot (and refuse to) own, is some sense of the fugitive law of movement that makes black social life ungovernable, that demands a para-ontological disruption of the supposed connection between explanation and resistance.""

kinship,Kinship,kinship,"<p>Keywords for Black Louisiana views ""kinship"" and the battle for kin as central to Black life in the New World. Kinship is the glue that knit Africans together in Gulf Coast Louisiana. Building and rebuilding fictive, chosen, and biological kin that reshaped bonds broken through the slave trade and the forced relocations of bondage in the New World occupied Africans and people of African descent from the moment of their initial capture on the content to the end of their lives.</p> 
<p>Larry Powell writes: ""Few aspects of African tradition were felt more strongly by slaves fresh from the homeland than a commitment to kinship. Severed from bloodlines, they invented new family ties on the spot. Fictive kinship was one type. Slaves acquired new siblings and new elders. But these arrangements were ad hoc and informal, anchored in nothing more solid than the sands of sentiment.</p>
<p>Gender, age, and reproductive capacity played an important role in kinship relations and rebuilding kinship and community. As Jessica Marie Johnson writes, ""Understanding the role intimacy and kinship played in black women’s lives highlights black women’s everyday understanding of freedom as centered around safety and security for themselves and their progeny. Safety, particularly safety from intimate violence, and security lay at the heart of decisions to secure or reject patrons, partners, lovers, and other kin. Black women’s intimacy with individuals ranged along the spectrum of coerced to strategic, from fraternal to sexual. Determined to build community and make generations, imagining futures that were, if not beyond bondage, at least buttressed against harm, they cultivated, protected, and defended kinship networks. They engaged in a range of practices meant to safeguard their bodies and their legacies. At times this included legitimating kinship ties through formal sacred institutions like the Catholic Church.""",,"Powell, Lawrence N.. The Accidental City (pp. 268-269).

manumission,Manumission,manumission,"Manumission is the act of freeing and being freed from slavery ""while the institution of slavery continues,"" as described by Randy J. Sparks and Rosemary Brana-Shte. Manumission was a critical act and strategy enslaved people engaged in as they struggled for control over the lives, selves, and kinship networks. Differentiated from emancipation, which were legislative acts and actions (i.e. U.S. Civil War) wholesale or conditionally (i.e. with apprenticeship) freeing all enslaved people across a given slaveholding society, manumission was executed by individual enslavers on behalf of their respective property (enslaved people) through formal (i.e. legal) action. Manumission was regulated by imperial and national officials in all slaveholding societies, but the rules of manumission varied across empire, region, even towns or colonial outposts. In French Louisiana, manumission was regulated by a succession of Code Noirs (1685, 1724) which determined the guidelines enslavers needed to follow to complete an act of manumission. In Spanish Louisiana, the French ordinances were replaced by Spanish manumission law guided by the Siete Partidas, eighteenth-century Spanish imperial Code Noirs and bandos de buen gobierno. The differences were stark between the two imperial eras. For example, during the French period, enslavers were required to secure ratification of the Superior Council for any manumissions. In the Spanish period, not could enslavers directly manumit their enslaved property, but enslaved people could also appeal to the Spanish Cabildo (Louisiana's governing body during the Spanish period) for their freedom. Coartación, the process of appealing for your freedom, allowed a critical mass of Africans and people of African descent to secure their freedom. The audacity, creativity and resistance practice of enslaved people demanding their legal freedom from their owners through coartación, laid the foundation for the free population of color that would emerge in the later years of the eighteenth-century.

wellness,Wellness,wellness,"Keywords for Black Louisiana views ""wellness"" expansively and radically to encompass an array of practices. For Africans in Gulf Coast Louisiana, wellness meant more than the physical health. Enslavers demanded control over Africans bodies, minds, and futures (via their reproductive labor). Wellness, for Africans, meant wresting control of their whole selves from enslavers. Wellness could mean body autonomy (laboring as they wished, playing as they wished, imbibing food and drink as they wished). It could mean spiritual practices that protected and preserve African systems of belief or maintained  ways of organizing the supernatural that varied from Catholic doctrine. It could mean play, mischief, even behavior the French marked as crimes such as theft or running away, since these crimes often created space for broader wellness practices (feasts, gatherings, and marroonage). 

Along with misreading wellness practices as crimes, enslavers also misread wellness practices as superstition. In 1734, Le Page du Pratz, for example described the creation of gris-gris, protective devices composed of natural and inanimate materials, as being ""very superstitious and attached to their prejudices."" As Gwendolyn Midlo Hall notes, ""Reference to grigri is found in New Orleans court records in 1773. Charms ritually fabricated and worn for protection, as well as charms intended to harm others, have kept their African names to the present day. Zinzin, an amulet of support or power in Louisiana Creole, has the same name and meaning in Bambara. Grisgris, a harmful charm, comes from the Mande word gerregerys. The words zvanga and grisgris are still widely used in New Orleans by speakers of English as well as by Creoles.""
