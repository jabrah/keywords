Along the way, the woman attempted to flee captivity, jumping into the water at the sight of another pirogue, which belonged to Indigenous passers-by whom she presumably knew, perhaps from a previous attempt at marronage about one year earlier. Although de Chavannes recaptured the woman, pulling her from the water and bringing her ashore, she successfully escaped into the woods never to be heard from again. As a result, de Chavannes petitioned the Superior Council to release him from his obligation to pay his debts for the sale of the woman and claimed she must have simply been insane to have wanted to escape.

In 1773, Catharina, enslaved on the Destrehan Plantation, claimed her freedom based on a new system of manumission that came to be called coartación.  A few things are important to note in her story. First, throughout the case,  Catharina argued for and defended her right to a lower self-purchase price based on an unspecified infirmity. How the participants reacted to her claims of disability is of interest to anyone studying the history of disability and how it intersects with race, gender, and bondage. Second, the enslaver of note in this case is none other than Étienne de Boré, the man known in the history of United States slavery as the innovator of sugar cultivation in Lower Louisiana. This makes Catharina's case a critical part of the history of the plantation in the United States.
