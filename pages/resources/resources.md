# Coming Soon!  

This is where we will collect resources and develop content for our various audiences. We plan to have a few paragraphs on how we are curating the collection to the five groups listed below and suggestions for engagement based on their goals. These pages could also include suggestions for particular documents that may be of distinct interest to people approaching the collection from different professional backgrounds. The links here are additional resources that can connect our project to other digital projects and pedagogical tools in conversation with our site across different settings. We will also add our bibliography here as another page. In the longer term, perhaps PDFs that include lesson plans or other printable materials, too.
