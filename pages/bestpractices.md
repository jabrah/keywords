Our work of annotating, transcribing, and translating documents from eighteenth-century (French and Spanish) Louisiana is informed by collaborative and community-engaged practices. Our goal is to provide access to the documents in Louisiana archival collections not only through the practice of transcription and translation, but also through the creation of stories that offer researchers, teachers, public historians, and artists access to the centuries-long freedom struggle of Black communities. We aim to create a resource for descended communities in Louisiana whose ancestors fueled some of the most important moments in American history. As Keywords for Black Louisiana, we hold ourselves accountable to descended communities and Black humanity.
