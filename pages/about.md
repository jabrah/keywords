!["Ve√ºe et Perspective de la Nouvelle Orleans" (View & Perspective of New Orleans), 1726. Ink and watercolor by Jean-Pierre Lassus. Detail of left side of illustation. View shows the young city of New Orleans from across the Mississippi River at Algiers Point. In the foreground, slaves labor on the West Bank (then a Company of the Indies plantation) downing trees. To right of center, a man spears an alligator. Small boats are on the Mississippi, with larger sailing ships across the River at the town. Trees are shown cleared only a short distance beyond the town limits. The road to Bayou St. John seen towards top center of view. This is said to be the only known contemporary view of the city from the first French Colonial era, before Louisiana was transfered to Spain in 1763.
