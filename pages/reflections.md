## Mona Lisa Saloy on the Black & Indigenous Research Adventure  

**Africans, their Descendants & Indigenous Connections #HonorNativeLand!**

Respectfully, I acknowledge the original native inhabitants of this land, air, water, and history of our beloved Louisiana, the first inhabitants of this place: the Atakapa, the Caddo, the Jena Band of Choctaw, Coushatta, the Chitimacha, Houma, the Natchez, the Tunica-Biloxi, for their timeless traditions of reverence to our cultures and space.  

**Black & Indigenous connections in the South, especially Louisiana**

As an author, Folklorist, and scholar, it is often overwhelmingly shocking to comprehend the depth and breadth of cultural, creative, and social contributions of Blacks in the New World despite being denied ancestral culture, language, names, geographical, religious origins. In spite of this, on top of the economic, physical, political, religious, and social limitations enforced for centuries, so much beauty was and continues to be produced that makes the Americas what they are today: from Carnival in Trinidad and South America; to gospel music, jazz, R&B, rap; to soul food now cuisine; to masking; to Hoodoo or Vodun (although those inside the culture do not use those terms, because they are socially coded, it’s nearly impossible not to use them for reference here and even in scholarship); to fashion and style. 

The first Africans, Moors, were brought by the Spanish to what later became South Carolina in 1526, by Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon, and also to Florida in 1565, by Admiral Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles. Those enslaved Moors of North Africa had a civilization already several hundred years old. They were highly-skilled craftsmen and artisans. Even the lovely arches and indigo tiles of Mexico are Moorish in origin. Dr. Ivan van Sertima teaches us in They Came Before Columbus, more Africans came by the 1500s and early 1600s. By the 1500s, once the Catholic Church declared that Indigenous were not to be enslaved (well, they knew nothing of the building trades colonial Europeans needed; plus, the massive agricultural imports from Africa needed tending), that decision fully-enforced the stealing of Africans to create wealth from white gold—sugar—or to be used in the building trades, in cattle driving and horse trading, including the herds used for the original westward expansion, alas, the Louisiana Purchase.  

While some Black Creoles (descendants of mixed-enslaved Africans born in the New World), were aware that in Louisiana many of the Indigenous welcomed run-away enslaved Blacks into the palmetto swamps for survival, little is documented and explained about what significant connections were maintained, culturally and socially. Certainly, the Elder Grand Uncle of Tootie Montana knew this and masked in honor of African ancestral masking traditions and also honored those Indigenous who intermarried and welcomed early Blacks, even hid them for their survival. Such stories were passed down but unproven. What foodways traditions do we share from such intersection of cultures and eventually families?  What other artistic traditions are handed down?  

It is this intersection of discovery that led me to embrace the Keywords for Black Louisiana project and it’s development of the digital collection of enslaved testimony from French and Spanish Louisiana. Literally desperate to learn specifics of cultural, historic connections and legacies earned between African descendants and Indigenous of the New World, we began and dug deep. Of course, outside of wanting to answer the questions above, there’s a need to fill in the blanks for curricular updates in Black American literature courses as well as American Literature and Multi-cultural literature classes that are taught within the context of the forces that gave rise to those works….  

As an author, Folklorist, scholar, Keywords’ Black & Indigenous project contributes to scholarly knowledge in English, Folklore, History, and literature, and to the general public’s understanding of this place. Final results will add to curricular reform and publications and is directly relevant to research themes of my work as an author of creative works, in Folklore, literature, and scholarship.
