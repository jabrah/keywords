Black Louisiana has shaped so much of the story of the United States that to not have ready access to the century of Black life before 1803 creates a structural flaw in how we tell our history. From wars between European empires, the entanglement of African slavery and Indigenous dispossession, to the abolition of the slave trade and rise of the domestic slave trade, the dynamism of Black culture, continental expansion and connections to the Caribbean, massive historical events and historiographic questions turn on history of slavery and colonialism in Louisiana. Yet, so little is known about how Black people in Louisiana lived, loved, resisted bondage, used the law, organized institutions, and created cultural traditions. What is known is considered niche or specific to the Gulf Coast's context or exceptional to the history of the rest of the country when,in fact, it is foundational to how the U.S. South took shape and therefore how the United States came into being. The list of major historical events these documents might impact is endless. The Louisiana Purchase, the Haitian Revolution, the Seven Years War. The material documenting the everyday lives of Africans in the Americas and the evolution of Black society is immense. These lives deserve and require accountable and creative use of digital tools to confront the violence of the archive they reside in inside out. Keywords participates in this work.
Keywords for Black Louisiana is guided by two premises. The first is that a century of African American history (and therefore American history) precedes the Louisiana Purchase that has yet to be integrated into broader histories of African American life or histories of the making of the United States. The second is that this century of African American history that precedes the Louisiana Purchase, if made accessible (digitized, transcribed, and translated), will not only add to the historical record a resource that it desperately needs, it will also fundamentally reshape how African American, African, African diaspora, hemispheric American, and United States history is told. The Louisiana colonial documents at the Louisiana Historical Center, which begin in 1714 and continue through 1803, offer stories like these and more, stories that have the potential to change and enrich what we think we know about Africans and people of African descent. Read more about how these premises guide our work here.
