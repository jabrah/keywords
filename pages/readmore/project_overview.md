> **LifeXCode** works to create futures beyond the academy and within communities. What is offered is a grammar of refusal and a langauge of freedom for the humanities, as well as an invitation to draw new lines over, under, and through to claim new relations.

> **Keywords for Black Louisiana** offers _digital portals_ into the history of __Africans and people of African descent__ in Gulf Coast Louisiana. Through thorough data collection such as building datasets, digital media, and archives we explore methodologies for studying Black New Orleans. This portal builds metadata for tracking Black life in Louisiana's earliest archive.
