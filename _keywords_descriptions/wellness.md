Description: "Keywords for Black Louisiana views \"wellness\" expansively and radically
  to encompass an array of practices. For Africans in Gulf Coast Louisiana, wellness
  meant more than the physical health. Enslavers demanded control over Africans bodies,
  minds, and futures (via their reproductive labor). Wellness, for Africans, meant
  wresting control of their whole selves from enslavers. Wellness could mean body
  autonomy (laboring as they wished, playing as they wished, imbibing food and drink
  as they wished). It could mean spiritual practices that protected and preserve African
  systems of belief or maintained  ways of organizing the supernatural that varied
  from Catholic doctrine. It could mean play, mischief, even behavior the French marked
  as crimes such as theft or running away, since these crimes often created space
  for broader wellness practices (feasts, gatherings, and marroonage). \r\n\r\nAlong
  with misreading wellness practices as crimes, enslavers also misread wellness practices
  as superstition. In 1734, Le Page du Pratz, for example described the creation of
  gris-gris, protective devices composed of natural and inanimate materials, as being
  \"very superstitious and attached to their prejudices.\" As Gwendolyn Midlo Hall
  notes, \"Reference to grigri is found in New Orleans court records in 1773. Charms
  ritually fabricated and worn for protection, as well as charms intended to harm
  others, have kept their African names to the present day. Zinzin, an amulet of support
  or power in Louisiana Creole, has the same name and meaning in Bambara. Grisgris,
  a harmful charm, comes from the Mande word gerregerys. The words zvanga and grisgris
  are still widely used in New Orleans by speakers of English as well as by Creoles.\"\r\n"
