Description: "<p>Keywords for Black Louisiana views \"kinship\" and the battle for
  kin as central to Black life in the New World. Kinship is the glue that knit Africans
  together in Gulf Coast Louisiana. Building and rebuilding fictive, chosen, and biological
  kin that reshaped bonds broken through the slave trade and the forced relocations
  of bondage in the New World occupied Africans and people of African descent from
  the moment of their initial capture on the content to the end of their lives.</p>
  \r\n<p>Larry Powell writes: \"Few aspects of African tradition were felt more strongly
  by slaves fresh from the homeland than a commitment to kinship. Severed from bloodlines,
  they invented new family ties on the spot. Fictive kinship was one type. Slaves
  acquired new siblings and new elders. But these arrangements were ad hoc and informal,
  anchored in nothing more solid than the sands of sentiment.</p>\r\n<p>Gender, age,
  and reproductive capacity played an important role in kinship relations and rebuilding
  kinship and community. As Jessica Marie Johnson writes, \"Understanding the role
  intimacy and kinship played in black women’s lives highlights black women’s everyday
  understanding of freedom as centered around safety and security for themselves and
  their progeny. Safety, particularly safety from intimate violence, and security
  lay at the heart of decisions to secure or reject patrons, partners, lovers, and
  other kin. Black women’s intimacy with individuals ranged along the spectrum of
  coerced to strategic, from fraternal to sexual. Determined to build community and
  make generations, imagining futures that were, if not beyond bondage, at least buttressed
  against harm, they cultivated, protected, and defended kinship networks. They engaged
  in a range of practices meant to safeguard their bodies and their legacies. At times
  this included legitimating kinship ties through formal sacred institutions like
  the Catholic Church.\""
