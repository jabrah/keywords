Description: "Manumission is the act of freeing and being freed from slavery \"while
  the institution of slavery continues,\" as described by Randy J. Sparks and Rosemary
  Brana-Shte. Manumission was a critical act and strategy enslaved people engaged
  in as they struggled for control over the lives, selves, and kinship networks. Differentiated
  from emancipation, which were legislative acts and actions (i.e. U.S. Civil War)
  wholesale or conditionally (i.e. with apprenticeship) freeing all enslaved people
  across a given slaveholding society, manumission was executed by individual enslavers
  on behalf of their respective property (enslaved people) through formal (i.e. legal)
  action. Manumission was regulated by imperial and national officials in all slaveholding
  societies, but the rules of manumission varied across empire, region, even towns
  or colonial outposts. In French Louisiana, manumission was regulated by a succession
  of Code Noirs (1685, 1724) which determined the guidelines enslavers needed to follow
  to complete an act of manumission. In Spanish Louisiana, the French ordinances were
  replaced by Spanish manumission law guided by the Siete Partidas, eighteenth-century
  Spanish imperial Code Noirs and bandos de buen gobierno. The differences were stark
  between the two imperial eras. For example, during the French period, enslavers
  were required to secure ratification of the Superior Council for any manumissions.
  In the Spanish period, not could enslavers directly manumit their enslaved property,
  but enslaved people could also appeal to the Spanish Cabildo (Louisiana's governing
  body during the Spanish period) for their freedom. Coartación, the process of appealing
  for your freedom, allowed a critical mass of Africans and people of African descent
  to secure their freedom. The audacity, creativity and resistance practice of enslaved
  people demanding their legal freedom from their owners through coartación, laid
  the foundation for the free population of color that would emerge in the later years
  of the eighteenth-century. \r\n"
