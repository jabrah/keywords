abstract: Spiritual songs sung in Fon (Nigeria, Benin, Togo) will not be mutually intelligible to someone of the Bambara nation (Senegambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire). However this linguistic/ethnic distinction is rendered insignificant to enslaver Leonard, who refers to these songs as "des chansons Negres."  

After a formal interrogation regarding Corbin's death or disappearance at the Criminal Chambers, Jeannot, an enslaved man of the Bambara nation, returns to working on the field. Leonard, his enslaver, goes out to the fields with a gun. He threatens to kill Jeannot for the possibility of conspiring to kill him (Leonard), for the murder/disappearance of Corbin (Leonard's neighbor), for lying about the conspiracy he engaged in with other enslaved/maroon africans two months prior to Corbin's death/disappearance, and for running away for 8 days to escape punishment from Leonard's wife.  

Jeannot already disclosed in the formal interrogation that he and his (unnamed) wife were experiencing violence at the hands of Leonard and his wife prior to the death of Corbin, and it is mandated that Jeannot be whipped until he confesses the same testimony to the court.  

Enslavers and their allies clearly feared the power of enslaved and free Black community gathering, as made evident by their questions surrounding what they call the “badinage” that took place two months prior to Corbin’s death.
