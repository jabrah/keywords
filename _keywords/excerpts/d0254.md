# Summary  
The city executioner, a Black man named Louis Congo, comes before the Superior Council of Louisiana to make official notice that he was attacked in his home by three runaway Native slaves. In response, the Attorney General of the King, François Fleuriau, urges the members of the Council to enforce the death penalty for deserters, a power given to them under King Louis XV’s newly decreed Code Noir (1724). The testimony in this case gives us a rare glimpse into the legal structure being formed in French Louisiana and the regime of violence under which enslaved people lived. But it also alerts us to the formation of maroon communities on the outskirts of the city who are willing to take up armed resistance against the colonial elite and their enforcers. Congo is presumed to have received his freedom in 1725 for taking up the duties of executioner, although he is not named so in this document.

To the Gentlemen of the Superior Council of the Province of Louisiana, *Exposé* [of] the Attorney General of the King that Louis Congo, *nègre* executioner of justice, came to complain that on the night of Thursday or Friday last, he believed he was being assassinated in his house by three *sauvage* deserters who had been bound by the Company [of the Indies] for two years to the gentlemen de Noyan and Raguet. For a long time, [it has been that] alarge group of sauvage slaves have gathered together as deserters [maroons], covetously circling the city, well armed, and whom must be vanquished [so that] they do not become a nuisance, having good provisions of gunpowder and bullets. The slave of *Sieur* Saint-Martin, [from] him having stolen 12 pounds of powder and 20 pounds of bullets.These desertions are always accompanied by thefts committed against their masters, and several habitants have asked me to punish the deserters, convinced that the punishments of which they have done themselves up until now have caused them to be put [at] risk. The King, extending his paternal kindness no matter how far we are [from him], gave in the month of May 1724 a regulation [*le Code Noir*] for this Province. Under Article 32,<sup>1</sup> by which it does not in fact order the death penalty for simple desertion, but by Articles 12<sup>2</sup> and 13<sup>3</sup>>, wherein he [King Louis XV] forbids [slaves] carrying weapons  and gatherings [of slaves]. He leaves it up to the arbitration of the courts to punish them to death, depending upon the circumstances. Here [in this case] there are  aggravating factors–such that one could never admit [that their] slaves intimidate them–for the death of at least of the leaders of the aforesaid plot for desertion and gatherings. That  is why, [if it] pleases you gentleman, pray [that] Mister [Pierre Dugué de] Boisbriand, Commanding General of this Province, President of the Council, order our sauvages surveille the said deserters, [so that we can] arrest them and place them all in our prisons, to know the leaders of the said plot, and

to complete their trail with all the rigor provided by the new Article aforementioned pertaining to the slaves of this Province.   At New Orleans on the seventeenth of August one thousand seven hundred twenty-six.
