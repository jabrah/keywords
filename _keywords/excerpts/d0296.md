# Summary  
An enslaved African man, Biron of the Bambara nation, is interrogated by the Superior Council for having run away from his enslaver and for resisting his recapture. This record highlights not only the violence of the French system of slavery, but also the limited rights afforded to enslaved people as well as the legal apparatus to enforce that enslavement while it was being developed in Louisiana.

Interrogation  
of the *nègre*, Biron  
—  
  
[Body:]   
  
No. 328  
[In] the year one thousand seven hundred twenty- eight [on] the tenth day of July [at] two o’clock in the afternoon, before us, Antoine Bruslé, advisor to the Superior Council of the Province of Louisiana, and at the request of the Attorney General of the King, plaintiff and accuser, were brought to the notary in person by four riflemen of the guard. The named *nègre*, Biron, the accused, for the purpose of being interrogated as to what has been carried out, and given that he does not speak French, we have appointed *ex officio* the named *nègre*, Samba Bambara, Christian, afterwhich [an] oath [was] taken by him to report faithfully to us the responses [given by] the said Biron upon the requests we will make of him.   
  
[When] asked of his name, address, and who is his master and his age, he said his name, Biron, Bambara *nègre*, and for the rest was *Sieur* Soubaigne.  
  
[When] asked why he often ran away, the interpreter reported to us that he said it is that he does whatever work that is ordered [by] his master, never leaves, and that [he] is often whipped.   
  
[When] asked to why he threw himself at the gun of his master when he brought him backto his house, the interpreter reported to us that he said that he grabbed the gun because he feared that his master was going to shoot his gun at him and thatit was not in [his] plan to use it against his master, and when he grabbed the gun it was broken [anyway].

Reading made to the interpreter of the present interrogation who, having reported it to the said Biron, reported to us that he said that it contains the truth that there is. And not knowing how to sign, neither him nor the other one, of this questioning, [accordingly] under the law.
